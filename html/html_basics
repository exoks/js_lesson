===[ HTML: basics ]=============================================================
- 'HTML' stands for hyperText Markup Language.
- 'HTML' is a markup language used to separate the layout from the logic in web
  development.
- 'HTML' file is converted into DOM document object modle.
- 'DOM' is manipulated by js javascript. 
- 'HTML' is used mainly to define the 'pages structure' 

# NOTE:=========================================================================
# - HTML IS NOT A PROGRAMMING language it is just a markup language.           |
# - While you can use js to define the pages structure (ex: by creating        |
#   elements and appending them to the DOM), IT is generally considred better  |
#   practice to keep structure (HTML), syle(CSS) and behavior (javascript)     |
#   => This makes your code cleaner and more maintable.                        |

> [ HTML versions: ] 
- HTML has different versions but what is good about it that you need
  to learn one version and dealing with the others 
  would be easy.
- You need to learn 'HTML5', in this version you can add videos, musics and
  canvas without the need of add 'external plugins'.
- 'Tim Bernver-lee' software engineer has been developed HTML since 1989,
  he has created 'W3C' company in 1994 to keep developing the 'html'. 
  - 1989 => HTML  (Tim Bernver-lee)
  - 1993 => HTML+ (Dave Ragget)
  - 1995 => HTML 2.0 (group of enginners) 
  - 1997 => HTML 3.2 (W3C)
  - 1999 => HTML 4.01 (W3C) 
  - 2014 => HTML 5 (W3C)
  - 2016 => HTML 5.1 (W3C)
  - 2017 => HTML 5.2 (W3C)
