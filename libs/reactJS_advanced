====<[ React: routing ]>=======================================================
> [ React: pages]
  - Traditional web application pages are built as HTML page for each page, 
  in addition to that we use tage <a> to add links enabling navigation 
  between pages
  - React pages are just one single page that has a set of components, It 
  depends on the way of displaying pages, it can be one component fit all
  page or part from page

# WARNING:
# - DO NOT USE <a> in React, this tag is desgined to move from HTML page to
# another, not betwen componens
# - In case of using it in react the whole page will be changed not only
# component.

# QUESTION: How to navigate between components ? 
# - use react-router-dom lib 
# - this lib is not part from react it's an external lib, you have to include it 
# before using it
# - to install: npm install react-router-dom@latest

  > [ react-router-dom: network ]
  - createBrowserRouter() 
  - <RouterProvider router={}> 
  - <Link to="path">text</Link>
  - <NavLink = to="path"> text </NavLink> 
  - <Outlet>
  - useParams()

  # INFO:
  # - It is all about routing, back or read it if you need.

====<[ react: designing using SASS ]>==========================================
- SASS is a dynamic css syntax that allows you to use enables to use varibales,
and define nested Rules, which is time optimiziation ...
- plays the role JSX another layer on top of CSS that simplifiy the process
of using CSS
- sass compiler is the once responsible to handle from sass css ==> css
- npm install sass 
- know you can add .scss files & use them exactly like .css files



====<[ react: vite tools ]>====================================================
- tool used to create & open web application as fast as you can 
- has been add from node 18+
- what is beautiful about it, it allows you to define which framework you 
want to use for building your project or what language do you want to use
javascript / typescript
 
# NOTE:
# - Most React Developers prefer to use Vite because it is the best options
# to build projects

  > [ react: Vite]
    1|_ npm create vite@latest
    2|_ define:
      |> Project name: test-app
      |> select a framework: >> React
      |> Select a variant: >> javascript

    3|_ cd test-app && npm install => to install all libs needed for the project 
    4|_ npm run dev => is used to run the project
    5|_ npm run build => to create a production copy of your project

====<[ react: sharing ]>======================================================= 
> 1|> node_modules directory
  - React projet my be large because the number of libs have 
  - files that can be deleted and not effecting the project must no be shared
  - delete node_modules, and tell the user to use 'npm install' to install
all node_modules that contains all libs

# TIP:
# - All used libs are included in package.json /package.lock.json files
# npm read from this files to know which libs must install & use

- 2|> build/dist
  - using npm run build will crate a dir dist/build that contains a copy from
  the project, REMOVE it
  > creaet-react-app ==> build/
  > nmp create vite ==> dist/
  - Log files should be deleted also

# INFO:
# - If you are using GIT don't forget to work .gitignore file 
# add node_module, build/dist ...
